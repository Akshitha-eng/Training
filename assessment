//Day 2:
1. Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.
Ans:
     Datatypes used to specify what kind of data stored in the variable.

Types of data types:-

1.primitive data types:-
- they are built-in
- immutable
- they can store only a single values
    -string
    -number
    -boolean
    -undefined
    -null
    -symbol
    -bigint
2.non-primtitive data types:-
- they are user defined
- mutable
- they can store multiple values.
    -array
    -functions
    -objects
    -math , date , json.

Strings:-
    Sequence of characters enclosed within "" , '' , ``(template literals/backtiks)


Number:-
    - -2^53-1 to +2^53-1 upto this range we consider as number data type.
    - beyond this range it will be bigint.

Boolean:- true / false.

Undefined:-
      -variable is declared but not initialized with the value.

Null:-
      -null is empty value / absence of an object.
      -return type of null is "object".

bigint:-
       -any value exceed the range of number dattype we consider that as bigint.
       -any value sufix with "n" will be bigint.
